# ATM Transaction Processing System
### Scenario
As a developer at a Money Transfer Company, I was tasked with evaluating the ability to conceptualize and design a solution, write code in the desired language and tools, understand container orchestration technology, and review practices such as commenting, code structure, and presentation skills.

### Technical Requirements
I designed a transaction processing system that allows users to log in securely with single sign-on, transfer funds, and withdraw money from an ATM, all while maintaining proper account balance checks. The system is built using the following technologies and tools:

- Backend: C# and .NET
- Frontend: React.js
- Container Orchestration: Docker and Kubernetes
- Database: Azure SQL
- Authentication: Azure Active Directory

### Installation and Setup
To run the transaction processing system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using npm install
3. Start the backend server using Visual Studio or the command dotnet run in the backend directory
4. Start the frontend server using npm start in the client directory
5. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

### Usage
The transaction processing system allows users to:

1. Log in with secure single sign-on using Azure Active Directory
2. Transfer funds between accounts, with proper balance checks
3. Withdraw money from an ATM, with proper account balance and ATM cash checks
